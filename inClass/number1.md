# Proverbs

## Chapter 3

*Write mercy and truth upon the tablet of your heart—Trust in the **Lord**—Honor Him with your substance—Whom the **Lord** loves He corrects—Happy is the man who finds wisdom.*

1. My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:

2.  For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.

3. Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

4. So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.

5. ¶ Trust in the **Lord** with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.

6. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.

7. ¶ Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the **Lord**, and depart from evil.

8. It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

9. Honour the **Lord** with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:

10. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.

11. ¶ My son, despise not the chastening of the **Lord**; neither be weary of his correction:

12. For whom the **Lord** loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
